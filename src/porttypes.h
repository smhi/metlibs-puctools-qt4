  porttypes.h -- defines names for hardware-independent types

  Author: LBS (who nicked it from NSCA's HDF distribution)
  Date:   1997-03-10 (creation)

  WARNING: Since these definitions are taken from the HDF files, it
  will NOT go well with header files like hdfi.h.  Therefore, if both
  HDF headers and porttypes.h are needed, include the HDF files first,
  like this:

    #include <hdf/hdf.h> // say...
    #include <porttypes.h>

    or, better still, drop this file altogether, because you won't need it.
